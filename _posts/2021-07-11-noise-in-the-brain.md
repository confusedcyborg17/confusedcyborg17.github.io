a writing experiment

Butterflies open and unfold into a larger machine, a production of atoms and whispers. Pine needles swirl and gather forming strange lifeforms, bound not by biochemistry and fluids, but dreams and ideals. A cloud yawns and falls into the space before it. An endless stream of energized quarks giggle, cutting through serenity that wasn’t there. There’s smudges on the sky that won’t go away. Tainted painting, corrupted by imagination. A collection of clockwork hums, finding new gears to turn, gears that were always there but never known. 

Then silence. The world turns beneath my feet. The noise in my brain produces a thousand inputs to ten thousand pathways, memories of a past that never was and a future that can’t be. Ideas of fantasy, drawn over a foreign reality. Awareness of awareness, noise begetting noise. A tunnel opens up leading me into a world I completely occupy.

But, I am a comet, a river, a bolt of lightning. I burn and consume myself, transforming continuously, losing myself to find myself instantly. Focus cuts through the static, panic fades and chaos becomes order. Blinded, I finally open my eyes to see.
