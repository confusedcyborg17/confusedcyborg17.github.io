welcome to my first post!

Welcome reader. Thanks for clicking. I thought I would take this space to
describe what I hope for this blog to become. I want this blog to focus on
emotion. I want to talk about what moves me and what inspires me. I also want to
talk about what saddens and disheartens me. This is a space to focus on becoming
more comfortable with vulnerability, but also to capture my perspectives and
thoughts in the moment.

I've got a variety of ideas for how I will structure posts here and in time I'll
experiment with different formats. For now, I've been thinking about writing a
series of posts about music and stories I have surrounding it.

I look forward to putting up more content here. I hope you enjoy it.
